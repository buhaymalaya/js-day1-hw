vist 2 of the code wars problems you've done so far and solve them using JavaScript instead. 
(Recommended to do easier problems starting out, if you would like to do harder challenges that is fine but not required.)

* Note: Don't forget to create an index.html and link the file to it in order to see your results, 
similar to what we did in class.

When completed, place your file inside of "JS-day1-HW", commit the finished code to github and

//==================Exercise #1 ==========//
/*Write a function that takes in the string and the list of dog names, loops through 
the list and checks that the current name is in the string passed in. The output should be:
"Matched dog_name" if name is in the string, if no matches are present console.log "No Matches"
*/
let dog_string = "Hello Max, my name is Dog, and I have purple eyes!"
let dog_names = ["Max","HAS","PuRple","dog"]

function findWords(){
    //Your code goes here
}

//Call method here with parameters

//============Exercise #2 ============//
/*Write a fucntion that takes in an array and removes every even 
index with a splice,
and replaces it with the string "even index" */

Given arr == ["Max","Baseball","Reboot","Goku","Trucks","Rodger"]

function replaceEvens(arr){
    //code goes here
}

//Expected output
//Given arr == ["Max","Baseball","Reboot","Goku","Trucks","Rodger"]
//Output arr == ["even index","Baseball","even index","Goku","even 
index","Rodger"]
